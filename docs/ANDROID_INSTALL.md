# 📱 Android Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install **Chore Chart** on your Android tablet as a native-feeling app (PWA).

## Prerequisites
-   **Android Tablet** (running Android 8.0+)
-   **Google Chrome** browser (recommended)
-   **Internet Connection** (for initial setup)

## 🚀 Installation Steps

1.  **Open Chrome**: Launch the Google Chrome browser on your tablet.
2.  **Navigate to the App**: Go to the official URL:
    > [https://smurf-frank.github.io/chore_chart/](https://smurf-frank.github.io/chore_chart/)
3.  **Wait for Prompt**:
    -   You might see a banner at the bottom saying **"Add Chore Chart to Home screen"**. Tap it.
4.  **Manual Install** (if no banner appears):
    -   Tap the **Menu** icon (three vertical dots `⋮`) in the top-right corner.
    -   Select **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
5.  **Confirm**: Tap **"Install"** in the confirmation dialog.

## ✅ Verification
-   Go to your tablet's home screen or app drawer.
-   Look for the **"CC"** (Chore Chart) icon.
-   Tap it to launch. The app should open **full screen** without any browser bars (address bar, navigation buttons).

## 🔄 Updates
The app automatically checks for updates. Since it's a PWA, you don't need to go to the Play Store. Just open the app while connected to Wi-Fi to receive the latest features.
